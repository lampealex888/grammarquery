# She Innovates Hackathon 2022

## Getting Started
In order to build GrammerQuery, you need an API key. This API key can be
obtained at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/grammarbot/api/grammarbot).

Then, this API key must be placed into a `KEY.js` file in the root of the
project directory.

Copy `KEY.js.example` to `KEY.js` and replace the `API_KEY` variable with your
own API key.
